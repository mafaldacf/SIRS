# Deploy Machines

For each machine, compile and run the project:

    cd ecoges
    mvn clean compile install -DskipTests


Run each module for each machine by providing the following possible values to `<module>` field: **webserver**, **backoffice**, **rbac**, **client** or **admin**. If desired, modules can be run on localhost by setting the development environment `-dev` before specifying the module.

    cd ecoges
    sudo chmod 777 run.sh
    ./run.sh <module>

# Capture and Analyze Network Traffic

If machines are deployed on Linux, you can analyze the packets that are being exchanged between the servers, clients and database.

For example, to verify that messages sent from the webserver and backoffice to the database are being encrypted and the content of the queries can't be disclosed, run the following tool on the **database** machine:

    sudo tcpdump -XX -X -i enp0s3

To capture all the traffic of the system, run the following tool  on the **firewall** machine. Alternatively, the interface can be specified:

    sudo tcpdump -XX -X
